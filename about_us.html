      About Amara Lighthouse
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; color: #333">
      Amara Lighthouse is more than a project — it's a revival of Myanmar's
      untold stories and timeless heritage. What started as a simple assignment
      turned into a journey through ancient scripts, forgotten kingdoms, and
      cultural treasures. We turned boredom in history class into curiosity, and
      curiosity into creation.

      Our mission is to make learning history fun, visual, and meaningful for
      the younger generation. Through storytelling, games, and interactive
      design, we bring the past to life — because to shape the future, we must
      first understand our roots.
